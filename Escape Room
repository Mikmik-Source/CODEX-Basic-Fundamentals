Instructions!!
We have the following escape room clue we need to solve!

I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?

Use the scanner to create a program that asks the user for their answer to the riddle. At the end, be sure to test it, and end the program with a congratulations phrase!

Code:

  public static void main(String[] args) {

      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      
      System.out.print("I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?" );
      String name = sc.nextLine();
      
      System.out.print("Congrats! it's " + name );
      
    }
}


// I was thinking to use the "try - else "method however the intruction was only to create a program using scanner etc.

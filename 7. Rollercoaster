Create a program that checks if you can ride the rollercoaster if you weigh above 40 kg and are taller than 120 cm.

If both conditions are met, print “Congrats! You can ride!” 🎢
Otherwise, “Sorry, You can't ride today.” 😞


public class practice1 {
	int weight = 40;
	int height = 120;
	
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    	practice1 practice = new practice1 ();
    	
    	if (practice.weight < 30 && practice.height>100) {
    		System.out.println("Congrats you can come");
    	} else {
    		System.out.print("Careful");
    	}
    }
}

// my code was practice.weight < 30 && practice.height<100) { I have no idea if its wrong but meh it's working.

Let's create a chant that we can use to show our support for your favorite artist or sports team! ðŸ“¢ 
Create a loop that displays 3 lines with the following format:


public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int i = 0;

        while (i <= 4) {
            System.out.println("LET'S GO MICHIGAN!!!!");
            i = i + 2;
        }
        
    }
}

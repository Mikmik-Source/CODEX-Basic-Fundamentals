In our challenge,

1 coin in Club Penguin is equal to $0.0045 USD.
Create a program that serves as a conversion calculator, where a penguin can enter the number of coins they have, and it will return how much money they have in USD!

 public static void main(String[] args) {
    	final double  Coinvalue = 0.0045;
      
 Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in);
        
        System.out.println("Welcome to Club Penguin Calculator Challenges");
        System.out.print(" Insert your coin here!");
        double coins =sc.nextDouble();
        
        
        double money = Coinvalue * coins;
        System.out.printf("You have $%.2f USD!%n", money); // I chatgpt this.
        
    }    //  I still used A.I in order to understand, also due to not familiarize on game and Currency of a USD, I used the resources in order to complete the challenges. dzuh.
}


Another Solution that I found on GITHUB 

 Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
         double exchangeRate = 0.0045;

         System.out.print("Welcome to the Club Penguin money converter!");
         System.out.print("How many coins do you have? ");
         int coins = scanner.nextInt(); 

         double dollars = coins * exchangeRate;
         
         System.out.println("You have the following amount of dollars:");
         System.out.println(dollars);

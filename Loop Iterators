We're going to create and write repeated affirmations for ourselves! In code, of course!

Use a for loop to repeat the following phrase 50 times. 


package Learning;

public class Learn {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int num = 0;
			for (int a1 = 0; a1 < 50; a1++) {
				System.out.println("I will be great at Programming" + num);
				num++;
			}
		

	}

}

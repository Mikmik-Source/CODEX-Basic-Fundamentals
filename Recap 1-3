Recap 1-3

// 
Creating variables
Data types (int, double, boolean, char, and String)
Using operators to write and solve math expressions
Adding user input to a Java program using the scanner util


// Code of 1-3 in one files.

public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in); // import.java.util.*; is must import on top of the public class!
        // Variables Basic
        int points = 23;
        double result = 0;
        System.out.println(" Your point is: " + points);
        // Data Types int, double, boolean, char and String 
        System.out.print(" EXP: ");
        int exp = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println(" The EXP was " + exp);
        // Math Expression ( I was kinda bad at this)
        System.out.println(" Next is Math Expression which already have a variable so you cannot really put something there since I didnt use scanner to it.");
        result =  40 / 20;
        System.out.println(" Result is " + result);
        // Scanner is already mention on Data types since data type is basically variable but have different variety. which is the boolean, char etc.
 
    }
}

I still have slightly confusion on datatypes since I was only using int at the moment, since the intruction clearly doenst tell me what should I used.
